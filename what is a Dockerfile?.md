# What is a Dockerfile?
It is a blueprint for building images. To build docker image for an application, we need to copy the content of the application into the dockefile (the artifact we built 'jar, war, etc...'). 

### the first line of every dockerfile is: 
#### > FROM
whatever image your building you wanna base it on another image, such as -> node for node.js apps, jdk for java apps, and so on. 
###### use the right image
You can find the images on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/)https://hub.docker.com/ 
Search for the image AND the version you need, or simply choose tha latest.

#### > ENV
to set the enviroment variables. 
such as: 

```
MONGO_DB_USERNAME=username \
MONGO_DB_PASSWORD=password
```
** NOTE THAT : it is an option, BUT it is better to write them in a docker-compose file. So instead of rebuilding the image, you can change the docker-compose file and override it.

#### > RUN
here you can execute any linux command -> example : mkdir -p /home/app
** NOTE THAT : this directory will be created and live INSIDE of the container not on the host

#### > COPY
this one executes on the HOST 
COPY . /home/app
. is the source , and /home/app is the target

#### > CMD 
is ALWAYS a part of dockerfile. what it does it executes an entry point linux command.

the left side of the image illustrate what actually happens in the container, what it can do. As on the right side, the commands we've just gone through.

# How to build an image using your Dockerfile

using 'docker build' command, you have to give your image 2 parameters 
1. -t NAME : TAG (( could be anything of your choice -> ex: my-app-name:version-1 ))
2. location of a Dockerfile (( if you are standing on the same folder as the Dockerfile, just provide a 'dot' which means 'current directory' ))


```
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
```
